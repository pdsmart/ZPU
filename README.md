The ZPU is a 32bit Stack based microprocessor and was originally designed by Ã˜yvind Harboe from [Zylin AS](https://opensource.zylin.com/) and original documentation can be found on the [Zylin/OpenCore website or Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPU_\(microprocessor\)). It is a microprocessor intended for FPGA embedded applications with minimal logic element and BRAM usage with the sacrifice of speed of execution. 

Zylin produced two designs which it made open source, namely the Small and Medium ZPU versions. Additional designs were produced by external developers such as the Flex and ZPUino variations, each offering enhancements to the original design such as Wishbone interface, performance etc.

This document describes another design which I like to deem as the ZPU Evo(lution) model whose focus is on *performance*, *connectivity* and *instruction expansion*. This came about as I needed a CPU for an emulator of a vintage computer i am writing which would act as the IO processor to provide Menu, Peripheral and SD services.

An example of the *performance* of the ZPU Evo can be seen using CoreMark which returns a value of 22.2 @ 100MHz on Altera fabric using BRAM and for Dhrystone 13.2DMIPS. Comparisons can be made with the original ZPU designs in the gallery below paying attention to the CoreMark score which seems to be the defacto standard now. *Connectivity* can be seen via implementation of both System and Wishbone buses, allowing for connection of many opensource IP devices. *Instruction expansion* can be seen by the inclusion of a close coupled L1 cache where multiple instruction bytes are sourced and made available to the CPU which in turn can be used for optimization (ie. upto 5 IM instructions executed in 1 cycle) or for extended multi-byte instructions (ie. implementation of a LoaD Increment Repeat instruction). There is room for a lot more improvements such as stack cache, SDRAM to L2 burst mode, parallel instruction execution (ie. and + neqbranch) which are on my list.


## The CPU

The ZPU Evo follows on from the ZPU Medium and Flex and areas of the code are similar, for example the instruction decoding. The design differs though due to caching and implementation of a Memory Transaction Processor where all Memory/IO operations (except for direct Instruction reads if dual-port instruction bus is enabled) are routed. The original CPU's all handled their memory requirements in-situ or part of the state machine whereas the Evo submits a request to the MXP whenever a memory operation is required.

The following sections indicate some of the features and changes to original ZPU designs.

### Bus structure

The ZPU has a linear address space with all memory and IO devices directly addressable within this space. Existing ZPU designs either provide a system bus or a wishbone bus whereas the Evo provides both. The ZPU Evo creates up to two distinct regions within the address space depending on configuration, to provide a *system bus* and a *wishbone bus*.

All models have the system bus instantiated which starts at cpu address 0 and expands up-to the limit imposed by the configurable maximum address bit (ie. 0x000000 - 0xFFFFFF for 24bit). A dedicated memory mapped IO region is set aside at the top of the address space (albeit it could quite easily be in any location) ie. 0xFF0000 - 0xFFFFFF.

If configured, a wishbone bus can be instantiated and this extends the maximum address bit by 1 (ie. 0x1000000 - 0x1FFFFFF for 24bit example). This in effect creates 2 identical regions, the lower being controlled via the system bus, the upper via the wishbone bus. As per the system bus, the upper area of the wishbone address space is reserved for IO devices.

A third bus can be configured, which is for instruction reads only. This bus typically shadows the system bus in memory region but is deemed to be connected to fast access memory for reading of instructions without the need for L2 Cache. This would typically be the 2nd port of a dual-port BRAM block with the 1st port connected to the system bus. 

### L1 Cache

In order to gain performance but more especially for instruction optimisations and extended instructions, an L1 cache is implemented using registers. Using registers consumes fabric space so should be very small but it allows random access in a single cycle which is needed for example if compacting a 32bit IM load (which can be 5 instructions) into a single cycle. Also for extended instructions, the first byte indicates an extended instruction and the following 1-5 bytes defines the instruction which is then executed in a single cycle.

### L2 Cache

Internal BRAM (on-board Block RAM within the FPGA) doesn't need an L2 Cache as it's access time is 1-2 cycles. As BRAM is a limited resource it is assumed external RAM or SDRAM will be used which is much slower and this needs to be cached to increase throughput. The L2 Cache is used for this purpose, to read ahead a block of external RAM and feed the L1 Cache as needed. On analysis, the C programs generated by GCC are typically loops and calls within a local area (unless using large libraries), so implementing a simple direct mapping cache between external RAM and BRAM (used for the L2 Cache) indexed relative to the Program Counter is sufficient to keep the CPU from stalling most of the time.

### Instruction Set

A feature of the ZPU is it's use of a minimal fixed set of hardware implemented instructions and a soft set of additional instructions which are implemented in pseudo micro-code (ie. the fixed set of instructions). This is achieved by 32byte vectors in the region 0x0000 - 0x0400 and each soft instruction branches to the vector if it is not implemented in hardware. The benefit is reduced FPGA resources but the penalty is performance.

The ZPU Evo implements all instructions in hardware but this can be adjusted in the configuration to use soft instructions if required in order to conserve FPGA resources. This allows for a balance of resources versus performance. Ultimately though, if resources are tight then the use of the Small/Flex ZPU models may be a better choice.

In addition to the original instructions, a mechanism exists to extend the instruction set using multi-byte instructions of the format:-

***Extend Instruction,<new insn[7:2]+ParamSize[1:0]>,[byte],[byte],[byte],[byte]***

Where ParamSize = 
  - 00 - No parameter bytes,<br> 
  - 01 - 8 bit parameter,<br>
  - 10 - 16 bit parameter,<br>
  - 11 - 32 bit parameter<br>

Some extended instructions are under development (ie. LDIR) an exact opcode value and extended instruction set has not yet been fully defined. The GNU AS assembler will be updated with these instructions so they can be invoked within a C program and eventually if they have benefit to C will be migrated into the GCC compiler (ie. ADD32/DIV32/MULT32/LDIR/LDDR as from what I have seen, these will have a big impact on CoreMark/Dhrystone tests).

### Implemented Instructions Comparison Table

![alt text](../images/ImplInstructions.png)

### Hardware Variable Byte Write

In the original ZPU designs there was scope but not the implementation to allow the ZPU to perform byte/half-word/full-word writes. Either the CPU always had to perform 32bit Word aligned operations or it performed the operation in micro-code.

In the Evo, hardware was implemented (build time selectable) to allow Byte and Half-Word writes and also hardware Read-Update-Write operations. If the hardware Byte/Half-Word logic is not enabled then it falls back to the 32bit Word Read-Update-Write logic. Both methods have performance benefits, the latter taking 3 cycles longer.

### Hardware Debug Serializer

In order to debug the CPU or just provide low level internal operating information, a cached UART debug module is implemented. Currently this is only for output but has the intention to be tied into the IOCP for in-situ debugging when Simulation/Signal-Tap is not available.

Embedded within the CPU RTL are selectable level triggered statements which issue snapshot information to the serialiser. The statements are expanded and then serialized and output to a connected terminal. A snapshot of the output information can be seen below (with manual comments):

All critical information such as current instruction being executed (or not if stalled), Signals/Flags, L1/L2 Cache contents and Memory contents can be output.

### Timing Constraints

This is a work in progress, I am slowly updating the design and/or adding constraints such that timing is fully met. Currently there is negative slack at 100MHz albeit the design fully works, this will in the future be corrected so timing as analyzed by TimeQuest will be met.


## System On a Chip

In order to provide a working framework in which the ZPU Evo could be used, a System On a Chip wrapper was created which allows for the instantiation of various devices (ie. UART/SD card). 

As part of the development, the ZPU Small/Medium/Flex models were incorporated into the framework allowing the choice of CPU when fabric space is at a premium or comparing CPU's, albeit features such as Wishbone are not available on the original ZPU models. I didn't include the ZPUino as this design already has a very good eco system or the ZY2000.

The SoC currently implements (in the build tree):

| Component                     | Option | Comment                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CPU                           | Yes    | ZPU Small, Medium, Flex, Evo or Evo Minimal.                 |
| Wishbone Bus                  | Yes    | 32 bit Wishbone bus.                                         |
| (SB) BRAM                     | Yes    | Implement a configurable block of BRAM as the boot loader and stack. |
| Instruction Bus BRAM          | Yes    | Enable a separate bus (or Dual-Port) to the boot code implemented in BRAM. This is generally a dual-port BRAM shared with the Sysbus BRAM but can be independent. |
| (SB) RAM                      | Yes    | Implement a block of BRAM as RAM, seperate from the BRAM used for the boot loader/stack. |
| (WB) SDRAM                    | Yes    | Implement an SDRAM controller over the Wishbone bus.    |
| (WB) RAM                      | Yes    | Implement a block of BRAM as RAM over the Wishbone bus.      |
| (WB) I2C                      | Yes    | Implements an I2C Controller over the Wishbone bus.     |
| (SB) Timer 0                  | No     | Implements a hardware 12bit Second, 18bit milliSec and 24bit uSec down counter with interrupt, a 32bit milliSec up counter with interrupt and a YMD HMS Real Time Clock. The down counters are ideal for scheduling. |
| (SB) Timer 1                  | Yes    | A selectable number of pre-scaled 32bit down counters.  |
| (SB) UART 0                   | No     | A cached UART used for monitor output and command input/program load. |
| (SB) UART 1                   | No     | A cached UART used for software (C program)/hardware (ZPU debug serializer) output. |
| (SB) Interrupt Controller     | Yes    | A prioritized configurable (# of inputs) interrupt controller. |
| (SB) PS2                      | Yes    | A PS2 Keyboard and Mouse controller.                    |
| (SB) SPI                      | Yes    | A configurable number of Serial Peripheral Interface controllers. |
| (SB) SD                       | Yes    | A configurable number of hardware based SPI SD controllers. |
| (SB) SOCCFG                   | Yes    | A set of registers to indicate configuration of the ZPU and SoC to the controlling program. |

Within the SoC configuration, items such as starting Stack Address, Reset Vector, IO Start/End (SB) and (WB) can be specified. With the addition of the wishbone bus, it is very easy to add further opencore IP devices, for the system bus some work may be needed as the opencore IP devices use differing signals.

### SDRAM



## Software


The software provided includes:

1. A bootloader, I/O Control Program (IOCP). This is more than a bootloader, in its basic form it can bootstrap an application from an SD card or it can include command line monitor tools and a serial upload function.
2. An application, ZPUTA (ZPU Test Application). This is a test suite and can be organised as a single application or split into a Disk Operating System where all functionality is stored on the SD card. ZPUTA can be bootstrapped by IOCP or standalone as the only program in the ROM/BRAM.
3. A disk operating system, zOS (ZPU Operating System). A version of ZPUTA but aimed at production code where all functionality resides as disk applications.
4. Library functions in C to aid in building applications, including 3rd party libs ie. FatFS from El. Chan

21/04/2020: Software for the ZPU has now been merged with the tranZPUter and is kept and maintained in the [zSoft](/zsoft) repository.


## Configuration

This section shows how to configure the ZPU and the SoC, either to use the ZPU seperately or as part of the included SoC.


### Configure the CPU

<br>The CPU is configurable using the configuration file 'cpu/zpu_pkg.vhd'. It generally specifies the size of the address bus and what hardware features should be enabled. The following table outlines the configurable options.

&nbsp;&nbsp;| Configuration Variable   | Model   | Values       | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -----   | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EVO_USE_INSN_BUS         | Evo     | true/false   | Use a seperate instruction bus to connect to the BRAM memory. All other Memory and I/O operations will go over the normal bus. This option is primarily used with Dual Port BRAM, one side connected to the Instruction Bus the other side to the standard bus and will give a significant performance boost when the executed code is in this memory. |
| EVO_USE_HW_BYTE_WRITE    | Evo     | true/false   | This option implements hardware writing of bytes, reads are always 32bit and aligned. |
| EVO_USE_HW_WORD_WRITE    | Evo     | true/false   | This option implements hardware writing of 16bit words,  reads are always 32bit and aligned. |
| EVO_USE_WB_BUS           | Evo     | true/false   | Implement the wishbone interface in addition to the system bus.  |
| DEBUG_CPU                | All     | true/false   | Enable CPU debugging output. This generally consists of core data being serialised and output via the UART1 TX. There are pre-defined blocks of debug data (debug level) for output but it is easy to add in another if your targetting a specific CPU area/instruction. |
| DEBUG_LEVEL              | All     | 0 to 5       | Level of debugging output. 0 = Basic, such as Breakpoint, 1 =+ Executing Instructions, 2 =+ L1 Cache contents, 3 =+ L2 Cache contents, 4 =+ Memory contents, 5=+ Everything else. |
| DEBUG_MAX_TX_FIFO_BITS   | All     | 2 .. ~16     | Size of UART TX Fifo for debug output. One point to note, if too much data is output and the output Baud rate too low, the CPU will wait so cache size is irrelevant. Cache is only useful if outputting small amounts of data (ie. a targetted instruction) where the cache never becomes full and the CPU doesnt need to wait. |
| DEBUG_MAX_FIFO_BITS      | All     | 2 .. ~16     | Size of debug output data records fifo. Each request to output data via the serialiser is made via debug records which consume memory, the more records available the less chance of the CPU stalling. |
| DEBUG_TX_BAUD_RATE       | All     | Any Baud integer value | This option sets the output Baud rate of the debug serializer transmitter, ie. 115200 |
| maxAddrBit               | All     | \<16..31n> + WB_ACTIVE | This option sets the width of the address bus. WB_ACTIVE adds 1 to the width of the bus if the WishBone bus is enabled as the wishbone bus operates in the top half of the addressable memory area. |

## Build

This section shows how to make a basic build and assumes the target development board is the [QMTECH Cyclone V board](https://github.com/ChinaQMTECH/QM_CYCLONE_V). There are many configuration options but these will be covered seperately.

<br>

### Software build

Jenkins can be used to automate the build but for simple get up and go compilation use the build.sh and hierarchical Makefile system following the basic instructions here.

1. Download and install the [ZPU GCC ToolChain](https://github.com/zylin/zpugcc). Install into */opt* or similar common area.
2. Setup the environment variable path.
```shell
    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/zpu/bin
```
3. Clone the [ZPU Evo](https://github.com/pdsmart/zpu) repository
4. Edit the \<zpu evo dir>/software/zputa/zputa.h file and select which functions you want building into the zputa core image (by default, all functions are built as applets but these will be ignored if they are built into the zputa core image). You select a function by setting the BUILTIN_<utility>  to '1', set to '0' if you dont want it built in.
5. Decide which memory map you want and wether ZPUTA will be an application or bootloader (for your own applications, it is they same kind of choice), see build.sh in the table below for options. Once decided, issue the build command.
```shell
    cd <zpu evo dir>/software
    # For this build we have chosen a Tiny IOCP Bootloader, building ZPUTA as an
    # application with a Tiny IOCP bootloader, the ZPUTA Base Address is 0x1000
    # and the address where Applets are loaded and executed is at 0xC000 
    ./build.sh -I 3 -O zputa -o 2 -B 0x1000 -A 0xC000
    # The build command automatically creates the VHDL BRAM images with the IOCP
    # Bootloader installed, thus you will need to build the ZPU Evo SOF bit stream
    # and upload it to the FPGA in order for the new Bootloader to be active.
```
6. Place an SD Card into your system and format it for FAT32 format then copy the files onto it.
```shell
    cd build/SD
    cp -r * <abs path to SD card, ie. /media/psmart/ZPU>
    # eject the SD card and install it into the SD card reader on your FPGA dev board. 
```

<br>

### RTL Bit Stream build

To build the FPGA bit stream (conversion of HDL into a configuration map for the FPGA), there are two methods:

1. Install [Intel Quartus Prime 17.1](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/17.1/?edition=lite) or later (or build a docker image described below).
2. Open Quartus Prime and load project (File -> Open Project) and select \<zpu evo dir>/build/QMV_zpu.qpf
3. Compile (Processing -> Start)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*alternatively*:-
1. Install [Intel Quartus Prime 17.1](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/17.1/?edition=lite) or later (or build a docker image described below).
2. Use the Makefile build system by issuing the commands.
```shell
    cd <zpu evo dir>/build
    make QMV_EVO
```


<br>

### ZPU Small Build

The ZPU Small CPU can be built by changing the configuration as follows:

````
cd <repository>
````
````
Edit: zpu_soc_pkg.vhd

1. Change to the desired CPU as follows:
    constant ZPU_SMALL                :     integer    := 1;                                                -- Use the SMALL CPU.
    constant ZPU_MEDIUM               :     integer    := 0;                                                -- Use the MEDIUM CPU.
    constant ZPU_FLEX                 :     integer    := 0;                                                -- Use the FLEX CPU.
    constant ZPU_EVO                  :     integer    := 0;                                                -- Use the EVOLUTION CPU.
    constant ZPU_EVO_MINIMAL          :     integer    := 0;                                                -- Use the Minimalist EVOLUTION CPU.

2. Disable WishBone devices as the ZPU Small doesnt support the wishbone interface:
    constant SOC_IMPL_WB_I2C          :     boolean    := false;                                            -- Implement I2C over wishbone interface.
    constant SOC_IMPL_WB_SDRAM        :     boolean    := false;                                            -- Implement SDRAM over wishbone interface.

3. Disable any other devices you dont need, such as PS2 by setting the flag to false.

4. If your using a frequency other than 100MHz as your main clock, enter it in the table
   below against your board. If you are using a different board, add a constant with
   suitable name and use this in your TopLevel (ie. as per E115_zpu_Toplevel.vhd).
   NB. If using your own board it is still imperative that you setup a PLL correctly to
       generate the desired frequency, this constant is used purely for timing based
       calculations such as UART baud rate:

    -- Frequencies for the various boards.
    --
    constant SYSCLK_E115_FREQ         :     integer    := 100000000;                                        -- E115 FPGA Board
    constant SYSCLK_QMV_FREQ          :     integer    := 100000000;                                        -- QMTECH Cyclone V FPGA Board
    constant SYSCLK_DE0_FREQ          :     integer    := 100000000;                                        -- DE0-Nano FPGA Board
    constant SYSCLK_DE10_FREQ         :     integer    := 100000000;                                        -- DE10-Nano FPGA Board
    constant SYSCLK_CYC1000_FREQ      :     integer    := 100000000;                                        -- Trenz CYC1000 FPGA Board

Edit: cpu/zpu_pkg.vhd

1. Disable wishbone interface as follows:
    constant EVO_USE_WB_BUS           :     boolean          := false;                               -- Implement the wishbone interface in addition to the standard direct interface. NB: Change WB_ACTIVE to 1 above if enabling.

2. If you want to enable debug output on UART 1 then set the DEBUG flag to true along with
   the correct baud rate and sufficiently large FIFO Cache:
    constant DEBUG_CPU                :     boolean          := true;                                -- Enable CPU debugging output.
    constant DEBUG_MAX_TX_FIFO_BITS   :     integer          := 12;                                  -- Size of UART TX Fifo for debug output.
    constant DEBUG_MAX_FIFO_BITS      :     integer          := 3;                                   -- Size of debug output data records fifo.
    constant DEBUG_TX_BAUD_RATE       :     integer          := 115200; --230400;                    -- Baud rate for the debug transmitter
````

Using Quartus Prime following the 'RTL Bit Stream build' above, build the RTL in the usual manner with this new configuration. You cannot use the Makefile build as it will entail Makefile changes so just use the Quartus Prime GUI at this time.<br><br>The software is the same and unless you have less memory, no changes need to be made to the software build.<br>

    constant ZPU_MEDIUM               :     integer    := 1;                                                -- Use the MEDIUM CPU.
    constant ZPU_FLEX                 :     integer    := 0;                                                -- Use the FLEX CPU.
    constant ZPU_EVO                  :     integer    := 0;                                                -- Use the EVOLUTION CPU.

Edit: cpu/zpu_pkg.vhd

1. Disable wishbone interface as follows:
    constant EVO_USE_WB_BUS           :     boolean          := false;                               -- Implement the wishbone interface in addition to the standard direct interface. NB: Change WB_ACTIVE to 1 above if enabling.

2. If you want to enable debug output on UART 1 then set the DEBUG flag to true along with
   the correct baud rate and sufficiently large FIFO Cache:
    constant DEBUG_CPU                :     boolean          := true;                                -- Enable CPU debugging output.
    constant DEBUG_MAX_TX_FIFO_BITS   :     integer          := 12;                                  -- Size of UART TX Fifo for debug output.
    constant DEBUG_MAX_FIFO_BITS      :     integer          := 3;                                   -- Size of debug output data records fifo.
    constant DEBUG_TX_BAUD_RATE       :     integer          := 115200; --230400;                    -- Baud rate for the debug transmitter
````

Using Quartus Prime following the 'RTL Bit Stream build' above, build the RTL in the usual manner with this new configuration. You cannot use the Makefile build as it will entail Makefile changes so just use the Quartus Prime GUI at this time.<br><br>The software is the same and unless you have less memory, no changes need to be made to the software build.<br>

<br>


### Notes on setting up a new development board 

If you are using your own FPGA board (ie. not one in the list I've tested and created Quartus configuration files for), please ensure you create these necessary files:
````
build/<name of your board>.qpf
build/<name of your board>.qsf
build/<name of your board>_Toplevel.vhd
````

It would be best if you copied an existing configuration and tailored it, ie. if your board uses the Cyclone IV then copy the E115_zpu* files and change as necessary. ie:
````
cp build/E115_zpu.qpf build/NEW_zpu.qpf
cp build/E115_zpu.qsf build/NEW_zpu.qsf
cp build/E115_zpu_Toplevel.vhd build/NEW_zpu_Toplevel.vhd
````

Assuming you copied an existing definition as per above, in the build/NEW_zpu.qpf file, change the PROJECT name according to your board name, ie:
````
PROJECT_REVISION = "NEW_zpu"
````

In the build/NEW_zpu.qsf file, change the pin assignments to those available on your board, ie.


````
#============================================================
# UART
#============================================================
set_location_assignment PIN_A7 -to UART_RX_0
set_location_assignment PIN_B7 -to UART_TX_0
set_location_assignment PIN_C6 -to UART_RX_1
set_location_assignment PIN_D7 -to UART_TX_1
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to UART_TX_0
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to UART_RX_0
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to UART_TX_1
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to UART_RX_1

set_instance_assignment -name CURRENT_STRENGTH_NEW "MAXIMUM CURRENT" -to UART_TX_1

#============================================================

set_location_assignment PIN_C7 -to SDCARD_MOSI[0]
set_location_assignment PIN_B8 -to SDCARD_CLK[0]
set_location_assignment PIN_A8 -to SDCARD_CS[0]
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to SDCARD_MISO[0]
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to SDCARD_MOSI[0]

set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to SDCARD_CS[0]
set_instance_assignment -name CURRENT_STRENGTH_NEW "MAXIMUM CURRENT" -to SDCARD_MOSI[0]
set_instance_assignment -name CURRENT_STRENGTH_NEW "MAXIMUM CURRENT" -to SDCARD_CLK[0]
set_instance_assignment -name CURRENT_STRENGTH_NEW "MAXIMUM CURRENT" -to SDCARD_CS[0]

#============================================================
# CLOCK
#============================================================
set_location_assignment PIN_AB11 -to CLOCK_25
set_instance_assignment -name IO_STANDARD "3.3-V LVTTL" -to CLOCK_25
#set_location_assignment PIN_AB11 -to clk_25M
````

In the above snippet, if you have PIN_Y7 available for UART 0 RX, then change as follows:
````
#set_location_assignment PIN_A7 -to UART_RX_0
set_location_assignment PIN_Y7 -to UART_RX_0
````

Do this for the UART, SD CARD and CLOCK as a minimum.

You will also have to check and change the PLL assignment, either using one of the predefined configs or creating your own.
````
set_global_assignment -name QIP_FILE Clock_25to100.qip
````

ie. If you have a 12MHz primary clock on your board, the use the defined 12->100MHz PLL by changing the QSF file line:
````
#set_global_assignment -name QIP_FILE Clock_25to100.qip
set_global_assignment -name QIP_FILE Clock_12to100.qip
````


In the build/NEW_zpu_Toplevel.vhd:


````
1. Ensure the PLL is set to the correct one configured in the QSF file and the correct
   clock name is used throughout the file, ie:

   #mypll : entity work.Clock_25to100
   #port map
   #(
   #    inclk0            => CLOCK_25,
   #    c0                => sysclk,
   #    c1                => memclk,
   #    locked            => pll_locked
   #);
    mypll : entity work.Clock_12to100
    port map
    (
        inclk0            => CLOCK_12,
        c0                => sysclk,
        c1                => memclk,
        locked            => pll_locked
    );

2. Update the reset logic to use any switch or key on the board that you wish to be a
   reset:

    reset<=(not SW(0) xor KEY(0)) and pll_locked;

3. Ensure the correct clock frequency constant is setup in the generic of
   myVirtualToplevel:

   #myVirtualToplevel : entity work.zpu_soc
   #generic map
   #(
   #    SYSCLK_FREQUENCY => SYSCLK_E115_FREQ
   #)

    myVirtualToplevel : entity work.zpu_soc
    generic map
    (
        SYSCLK_FREQUENCY => SYSCLK_<NEW BOARD>_FREQ
    )

4. Ensure in the port map of myVirtualToplevel that unused components are set to open
   for outputs and '1' or '0' for the inactive state for inputs, ie:

    port map
    (    
        SYSCLK            => sysclk,
        MEMCLK            => memclk,
        RESET_IN          => reset,
    
        -- RS232

        UART_RX_1         => UART_RX_1,
        UART_TX_1         => UART_TX_1,
    
        -- SPI signals
        SPI_MISO          => '1',                              -- Allow the SPI interface not to be plumbed in.

### Connecting the Development board

1. In order to run the ZPU Evo iand it's software in basic form on the QMTECH board you need 2 USB to Serial (ie. [USB to Serial](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Laqiya-FT232RL-Converter-Adapter-Breakout/dp/B07H6XMC2X)) adapters and you wire them up according to the pinout as is defined in the \<zpu evo dir>/build/QMV_zpu.qsf file. Ensure the adapters are set to 3.3V. See Images section for colour coded wiring.
```shell
##============================================================
# UART
#============================================================
set_location_assignment PIN_AA14 -to UART_RX_0
set_location_assignment PIN_AA15 -to UART_TX_0
set_location_assignment PIN_Y15  -to UART_RX_1
set_location_assignment PIN_AB18 -to UART_TX_1
```
2. Open two Minicom/MobaXterm or equivalent serial consoles, setting the Serial port to one of the USB adapters in each. Setup the Baud Rate to 115200, with 8N1 formatting. Ensure auto line feed is enabled with Carriage Return.
3. Connect the USB Blaster between the QMTECH board and the PC.
4. Connect an SD Card Reader (ie. [SD Card Reader](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Micro+SD+Card+Reader+Module&i=computers&ref=nb_sb_noss)) to the QMTECH board according to the pinout as is defined in the \<zpu evo dir>/build/QMV_zpu.qsf file. See Images section for colour coded wiring.
```shell
##============================================================
# SD CARD
#============================================================
set_location_assignment PIN_Y17  -to SDCARD_MISO[0]
set_location_assignment PIN_AA18 -to SDCARD_MOSI[0]
set_location_assignment PIN_AA20 -to SDCARD_CLK[0]
set_location_assignment PIN_Y20  -to SDCARD_CS[0]
```
5. Insert the SD card created in the Software build above.
6. Open the Quartus Programmer (ie. Quartus Prime -> Tools -> Programmer), select the sof file via 'Add File' which will be in the directory \<zpu evo dir>/build/QMV_zpu.sof (QMV_EVO.sof if build was via Makefile) and setup the hardware via 'Hardware Setup'. 
7. Program the FPGA via 'Start' and on success, in the serial terminal window you will see the ZPUTA sign on message.

| iocp    |          | A small bootloader/monitor application for initialization of the ZPU. Depending upon configuration this program can either boot an application from SD card or via the Serial Line and also provide basic tools such as memory examination. |
| startup |          | Assembler and Linker files for generating ZPU applications. These files are critical for defining how GCC creates and links binary images as well as providing the micro-code for ZPU instructions not implemented in hardware. |
| utils   |          | Some small tools for converting binary images into VHDL initialization data. |
| zputa   |          | The ZPU Test Application. This is an application for testing the ZPU and the SoC components. It can either be built as a single image for pre-loading into a BRAM via VHDL or as a standalone application loaded by the IOCP bootloader from an SD card. The services it provides can either be embedded or available on the SD card as applets depending on memory restrictions. |

## Quartus Prime in Docker 

Installing Quartus Prime can be tedious and time consuming, especially as the poorly documented linux installation can lead to a wrong mix or missing packages which results in a non-functioning installation. To ease the burden I have pieced together a Docker Image containing Ubuntu, the necessary packages and Quartus Prime 17.1.1.

1. Clone the repository:

    ````bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/pdsmart/zpu.git
    cd zpu/docker/QuartusPrime
    ````

    Current configuration will build a Lite version of Quartus Prime. If you want to install the Standard version, before building the docker image:
    
    ````
    Edit:        zpu/docker/QuartusPrime/Dockerfile.17.1.1
    Uncomment:   '#ARG QUARTUS=QuartusSetup-17.1.0.590-linux.run' 
    Comment out: 'ARG QUARTUS=QuartusLiteSetup-17.1.0.590-linux.run'.
    ````
   
    If you have a license file: 

    ````
    Copy: <your license file> to zpu/docker/QuartusPrime/files/license.dat
    Edit:  zpu/docker/QuartusPrime/run.sh
    Change: MAC_ADDR="02:50:dd:72:03:01" so that is has the MAC Address of your license file.
    ````

   Build the docker image:

    ````bash
    docker build -f Dockerfile.17.1.1 -t quartus-ii-17.1.1 .
    ````


2. Setup your X DISPLAY variable to point to your xserver:

    ````bash
    export DISPLAY=<x server ip or hostname>:<screen number>
    # ie. export DISPLAY=192.168.1.1:0
    ````

    On your X server machine, issue the command:

    ````bash
    xhost +
    # or xhost <ip of docker host> to maintain security on a non private network.
    ````

3. Setup your project directory accessible to Quartus.

    ````bash
    Edit:        zpu/docker/QuartusPrime/run.sh
    Change:      PROJECT_DIR_HOST=<location on your host you want to access from Quartus Prime>
    Change:      PROJECT_DIR_IMAGE=<location in Quartus Prime running container to where the above host directory is mapped>
    # ie. PROJECT_DIR_HOST=/srv/quartus
          PROJECT_DIR_IMAGE=/srv/quartus
    ````

3. Run the image using the provided bash script 'run.sh'. This script 

    ````bash
    ./run.sh
    ````

    This will start Quartus Prime and also an interactive bash shell.<br>On first start it currently asks for your license file, click 'Run the Quartus Prime software' and then OK. It will ask you this question everytime you start a new container albeit Im looking for a work around.<br>
    The host devices are mapped into the running docker container so that if you connect a USB Blaster it will be seen within the Programmer tool. As part of the installation I install the udev rules for USB-Blaster and USB-Blaster II as well as the Arrow USB-Blaster driver for use with the CYC1000 dev board.

4. To stop quartus prime:

    ````
    # Either exit the main Quartus Prime GUI window via File->Exit
    # or
    docker stop quartus
    ````

### Images of ZPUTA on a ZPU EVO CPU

#### ZPU Performance
![ZPUTA Performance Test](../images/ScreenZPU1.png)
Dhrystone and CoreMark performance tests of the ZPU Evo CPU. Depending on Fabric there are slight variations, these tests are on a Cyclone V CEFA chip, on a Cyclone IV CE I7 the results are 13.2DMIPS for Dhrystone and 22.2 for CoreMark.

![ZPUTA Performance Test](../images/ScreenZPU4.png)
Same test as above but on a Cyclone 10LP with limited resources, only using single port memory with no instruction bus, the results are 10.0DMIPS for Dhrystone and 17.96 for CoreMark.

![ZPUTA Help Screen Test](../images/ScreenZPU2.png)
Help screen for ZPUTA, help in this instance is an applet on the SD Card. A * before the description indicates the command is on SD, a - indicates the command is built-in.

![ZPUTA SD Directory](../images/ScreenZPU3.png)
SD Directory listings of all the compiled applets.

#### SDRAM Performance

![ZPUTA SDRAM Performance Sysbus No Cache](../images/ZPUSDRAMPerformance.png)
SDRAM operating over the SYSBUS and with no cache. Not quite true memory performance as the ZPU makes several stack operations for a memory read/write, ie. IM <address>, IM <data>, STORE for a write which would entail upto 11 instruction reads (3 cycles on the Evo) and two stack writes.

![ZPUTA SDRAM Performance Sysbus Cache](../images/ZPUSDRAMPerformanceCached.png)
SDRAM operating over the SYSBUS with full page cache per bank for read and write-thru cache for write.

![ZPUTA SDRAM Performance Wishbone Bus No Cache](../images/ZPUWBSDRAMPerformance.png)
SDRAM operating over the WishBone Bus and with no cache.

![ZPUTA SDRAM Performance Wishbone Bus Cache](../images/ZPUWBSDRAMPerformanceCached.png)
SDRAM operating over the WishBone Bus with full page cache per bank for read and write-thru cache for write.
